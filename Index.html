<h2>What is it ?</h2>
<h3> The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be </h3>
    
<h3>displayed in a web browser. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. It is often assisted </h3>
    
<h3>  by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</h3>

<h3>  Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the</h3>
    
<h3>   documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for its appearance.</h3>
    
<h3>   HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images </h3>
    
<h3> and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to </h3>
    
<h3>   create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, </h3>
    
<h3>   quotes, and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as and  directly </h3>                                          <img src="הורדה (31).jpg" />  
    
<h3>  introduce content into the page. Other tags such as and surround and provide information about document text and may include sub-element tags.</h3>
    
<h3>  Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page. </h3>
    
<h3>  HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which </h3>
    
<h3> affects the behavior and content of web pages. The inclusion of CSS defines the look and </h3>
    
<h3>layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and </h3>
    
<h3>  current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML</h3>
    
<h3>   since 1997.[2] A form of HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily using the  element, together with JavaScript.</h3>
